# FightStat
Developing a browser extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that prompts a pop-up detailing a UFC fighter’s history when the user has the mouse hovered over a UFC fighter’s name. I created the project because I constantly forget the records of fighters due to the frequency of fights every week now a days, this will stop the constant opening of a new tab to update myself on a fighter!

# Roadmap
1.) Create JSON object that holds API in a txt file in order to minimize or avoid constant calls to API
2.) Whenever you hover object, load data from span
3.) Implement Facial Recgonition 
4.)
